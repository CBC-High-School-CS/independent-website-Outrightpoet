            <h1><b>Totally Legit Website Privacy Policy</b></h1>
            <h3><b>Effective Date: When you thought about clicking on this website</b></h3>

            <h2><b>1. Data Collection (Nothing to See Here)</b></h2>
            <p>
                <br />We collect absolutely no personal data. None at all. Except when:
                <br />You visit the site.
                <br />You click on anything.
                <br />You think about clicking on something.
                <br />You step away from your device (that’s when we collect the best stuff).
                <br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <h2><b>2. How We Use Your Data (We Don’t, Probably)</b></h2>
            <P>
                <br />We might use your data to:
                <br />Improve your experience (but mostly ours).
                <br />Sell to the highest bidder (just kidding… unless?).
                <br />Predict your next move in an unsettlingly accurate way.
                <br />Summon an ancient internet spirit that feeds on metadata.
                <br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <h2><b>3. Cookies (Delicious and Inescapable)</b></h2>
            <P>
                <br />Our cookies are different. They don’t just track you—they judge you. You can clear them, but they’ll be back… stronger.
                <br />
                <br />
            </P>
            <h2><b>4. Third-Party Sharing (The Party Never Ends)</b></h2>
            <P>
                <br />We only share your data with:
                <br />Mysterious entities that promise they’re “totally trustworthy.”
                <br />A secret underground cabal of fan theorists.
                <br />The one guy who always leaks spoilers.
                <br />
                <br />
            </P>
            <h2><b>5. Your Rights (Or Lack Thereof)</b></h2>
            <P>
                <br />You have the right to:
                <br />Request your data. We’ll send it via carrier pigeon (ETA: 2078).
                <br />Ask us to delete your data, which we’ll totally pretend to do.
                <br />Accept your fate and embrace the all-seeing eye of this website.
                <br />
                <br />
            </P>
            <h2><b>6. Changes to This Policy (If You Notice, It’s Too Late)</b></h2>
            <P>
                <br />We update this policy whenever we feel like it. If you continue using the site, you agree to everything—yes, everything.
                <br />By using this website, you acknowledge that privacy is an illusion, free will is debatable, and you might now be part of something bigger… and slightly ominous.
                <br />Enjoy the content!
                <br />
