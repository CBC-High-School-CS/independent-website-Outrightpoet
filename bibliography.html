                Connor Norton is a student at Christian Brothers College (CBC) High School in St. Louis, Missouri, known for his involvement in various academic and extracurricular activities.
                <br /><br /><b>STEM Initiatives&#58;</b>
                <br /><br />In March 2024, Connor was part of a CBC team that won first place at World Wide Technology's Eighth Annual STEM Student Forum. The team developed a solution to recycle plastic bottles into 3D-printed items like combs, toothbrushes, and plastic bricks for constructing tiny homes for the homeless. Their innovative approach earned them a $10,000 grant to implement their project.
                <br />Connor also served as a mentor in CBC's STEMathon! program, guiding middle school students in solving real-world problems. Specifically, he mentored a team from St. Clement of Rome School, which was among the top five teams presenting their projects in November 2024.
                <br /><br /><b>Artistic Achievements&#58;</b> 
                <br /><br />In December 2024, Connor's photography skills were recognized when his image was selected for display in a CBC High School exhibition. 
                <br />Through his diverse contributions in STEM mentorship and the arts, Connor exemplifies the well-rounded student community at CBC High School.
